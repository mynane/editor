# ORY Editor Example(s)

Please follow the [installation steps](../README.md) first, and then run:

* `npm run start` - a New York Times article that was rebuilt using the ORY Editor. This
repository is primarily a tech demo and optimized for manual testing.

Please note that `start` scripts run in development mode, which has a negative impact on performance.
